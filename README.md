# zoning
The goal of this project is to prepare and visualize a _zoning_ `.shp` file in order to encourage and streamline local business initiatives.

Each zone is represented by an individual `.GeoJSON` layer, and can be viewed individually by clicking on any of the layers [here](https://github.com/Tele-Pet/zoning/tree/master/GeoJSON_lyrs), or all layers at once [here](https://github.com/Tele-Pet/zoning/blob/master/GeoJSON_lyrs/zoning_4326.geojson).

A rough draft of a custom Leaflet-based map has been started [here](https://github.com/Tele-Pet/zoning/tree/master/qgis_to_leaflet/export_2015_09_06_10_35_09).  It can be downloaded and viewed locally in browser by opening the `index.html` file.

Existing documentation detailing zoning data is available [here](http://www.cityofdayton.org/departments/pcd/planning/Pages/ZoningMap.aspx), and will need to be researched in order to further refine any data visualizations.
